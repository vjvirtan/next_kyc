#KYC Management Demo

##Overview
This is a demo application built with Next.js for managing Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. The backend for this application is built with Java Spring and can be found in a separate repository https://github.com/vjvirtan/KYC. 

Live demo is available https://kyc.firehay.com

##Future Development Areas
This is my first Next.js project, so the code is a bit messy. When I have time, I will streamline the directory structure and correct the use of capitalization, as well as clean up unnecessary elements. I might also move application translations to GroupValidation repository https://github.com/vjvirtan/GroupValidation, where field translations and validation rules already originate via KYC repository.

##Missing features
Because this is demonstration of workflow more than application there will be a lot of missing features.
- Company as an owner
- Document handling
- Risk analysis
- etc

##Usage
Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can use the application to manage basic KYC processes.
